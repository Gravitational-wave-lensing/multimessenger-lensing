**Rules**: Keep it simple and documentation short. 

*Packages in alphabetical order (keep short):*__
**gwsnr**: Software for computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a given binary system fast.__
Example use-cases: Compute the signal-to-noise ratio and pdet of a given binary compact object system.__
Dependencies: N/A

**LeR**: Software for statistical modeling of gravitational-wave lensing. 
Example use-cases: (1) Compute the rate of strong lensing for a given binary black hole population model and galaxy lens population model; (2) create strong lensing injections; (3) estimate the strong lensing posterior Odds.
Dependencies: Uses gwsnr for fast signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computation.
